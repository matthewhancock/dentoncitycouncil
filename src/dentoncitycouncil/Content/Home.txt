<h2 class="blue tac">Thank You Portsmouth!</h2>
I am excited to serve all of Portsmouth as a member of your City Council. I plan to provide the <b>fresh face</b> and forward thinking leadership that is needed to make a positive difference for everyone. Please continue to share your ideas with me as you did when I went door to door campaigning. I look forward to working with you to stand up for the values we share. 
 
Thanks again,
