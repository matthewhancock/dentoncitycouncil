I am excited to announce that I will again seek a seat on Portsmouth's City Council. I am running because my unique combination of experience and effective leadership will provide a needed <b>fresh face</b> to make a positive difference for all of Portsmouth.

In 2013, I offered <b>moderate unifying solutions</b> to issues that other candidates were very passionate about. I will continue to offer practical unifying positions on all of the issues. However, this election I will also offer solutions that work towards the issue I am most passionate about: sustainability.

I have been called "ahead of the times" for my pursuits of a Deer Street parking garage over two years ago and sustainability today. As a <b>forward thinking leader</b>, I understand the need to embrace the sharing economy. Furthermore, as someone who moved to the Port City because of our energy, I strongly support our outdoor activities, programing, and music that keeps Portsmouth vibrant.

Please share your ideas with me as I go <b>door to door</b> reintroducing myself to residents every weekend until election day. In the meantime, please explore this website to learn more about me, my 2013 City Council campaign, and my recent efforts on sustainability.

I pledge to run another <b>positive campaign</b> that shows respect for all candidates, and I look forward to working with you to stand up for the values we share. I am confident that together, we can win in November.
