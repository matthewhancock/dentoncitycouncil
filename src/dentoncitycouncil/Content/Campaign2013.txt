I am proud of my positive 2013 City Council campaign, and stand by the practical unifying solutions I offered. I am also pleased that the City Council eventually unanimously voted to implement the major proposals I advocated for: a <b>Deer Street parking garage</b> as an alternative to a Worth Lot parking garage; implementing <b>form-based zoning</b> in the Historic District and then expanding it to the Northern Tier and Islington Corridor; and <b>repurposing</b> the Paul A. <b>Doble Army Reserve Center</b> as a senior activities center.
