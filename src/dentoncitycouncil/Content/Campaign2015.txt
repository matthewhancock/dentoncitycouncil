My successful 2015 City Council campaign built off my previous run. I continued to offer <b>moderate unifying solutions</b> and took practical positions on all of the issues. As someone who moved to the Port City because of our energy, I strongly supported our outdoor activities, programming, and music to <b>keep Portsmouth vibrant</b>. Having waited tables after the Army and after law school, I fully understood our need for more <b>affordable housing</b>. I also spoke often on the issue I am most passionate about: <b>sustainability</b>.
