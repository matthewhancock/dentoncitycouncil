The best way you can help elect me is with a <b>magnetic bumper sticker</b> on your car, a <b>lawn sign</b>  in your yard, or by making a <b>donation</b>  that will go towards mailing postcards that will be sent out closer to the election. 

The printing and postage for a single 4"x 6" postcard sent only to the residents that voted in the 2013 City Council election will cost an estimated $2,105. The goal of the campaign is to send <b>three mailings</b>.

Please share your interest in my campaign with your family, friends, and neighbors. <b>Together we can win on November 3!</b>
