All politics are local. The environment, climate change, and America's energy independence are not just big intangible ideas for only state, federal, and foreign governments to address. As individuals, communities, and as a city, we all have a stake in, and consciously choose to take action towards, a more <b>sustainable future</b>.

Portsmouth is both an eco-municipality and a recipient of the Gulf of Maine Council's 2015 Sustainable Communities Award. City staff are focused on sustainability, but we need City Councilors that are willing to <b>take action</b> on large impact items, like the five initiatives I helped present to the City Council last November as a member of the Blue Ribbon Committee on Sustainable Practices. 

I have been leading a <b>successful public education campaign</b> on these initiatives for over a year. Although our City Councilors have chosen to take no action on any of these proposals, the public now has a greater awareness of how we can become more sustainable.
