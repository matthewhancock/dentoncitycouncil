I have always believed in civic duty and <b>public service</b>; first as an Eagle Scout, then as a U.S. Army officer, and now as a candidate. I fell in love with Portsmouth when I was an undergraduate at the University of New Hampshire and thought about the Port City often while I was in the Army. I moved here in 2007, upon returning from serving as a combat adviser to an Iraqi infantry battalion in Baghdad, Iraq.

In 2009, while waiting tables at Flatbread, I earned my <b>Master of Public Administration</b> from my alma mater. When the Post-9/11 GI Bill went into effect that fall semester, I attended the University of New Hampshire's School of Law to become an <b>attorney</b>. I focused on criminal law and served as counsel on six jury trials. Upon graduating in 2012, I returned to Flatbread while I successfully studied for the bar exam and helped organize Portsmouth's "Welcome Home" End of the Iraq War Parade. 

After the 2012 election, I became the Congressional District's Veterans Liaison and then the <b>Outreach Director</b>. In my official capacity, I helped obtain from the federal government the Paul A. Doble Army Reserve Center, Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) funding for the new Sarah Mildred Long Bridge, and a Federal Rail Administration official to publicly answer questions on Sea-3 rail safety.

With a passion for sustainability on the local level, and energy independence on a national level, I toured in my official capacity everything from Poly Recovery, to Schiller Station's biomass plant, to Groton's wind farm. After my unsuccessful 2013 City Council bid, the Mayor asked if I would be interested in joining any city boards, and I joined Portsmouth's Blue Ribbon <b>Committee on Sustainability Practices</b>. 

I advocate for sustainability and energy independence to <b>reduce military engagements</b> rooted in our reliance on foreign energy. With the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, I strongly encouraged Congresswoman Shea-Porter to push for a war declaration and to otherwise vote against limited measures that would send the same one percent of Americans that fought our past decade's wars into another conflict.

The day after the Congresswoman voted against solely arming the Syrian rebels in 2014, I thanked her for her vote and told her I accepted a position as the <b>Congressional Liaison for the Army Labs</b> outside of Boston. The labs research, develop, and engineer everything soldiers wear, carry, and eat. I take pride in the labsâ€™ work towards more sustainable expeditionary base camps that seek to save lives by reducing fuel consumption by 25%, water consumption by 75%, and black waste disposal by 50%.

I live with and am often seen walking my two dogs downtown.
